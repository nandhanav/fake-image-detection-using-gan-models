Detecting fake or manipulated images in today's digital age has become increasingly challenging due to the advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These AI-powered tools have made it easier than ever to create convincing fake images that can deceive both human observers and traditional image analysis techniques. The problem at hand is to develop a robust and effective fake image detection system that can differentiate between genuine and manipulated images generated by GAN models.

Objective:
Develop a fake image detection system that can distinguish between real and AI generated images.



The code is for a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. CNNs are typically used for image classification tasks, and they work by learning the important features in an image and then using those features to predict the image's class.

The first step in building a CNN is to define the model's architecture. The architecture of a CNN consists of a stack of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers learn the important features in the image, the pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the image, and the fully connected layers classify the image.

The next step is to compile the model. This involves specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to be used during training.

Once the model is compiled, it can be trained on a dataset of images. The training process involves feeding the images into the model and then updating the model's weights so that it learns to correctly classify the images.

After the model is trained, it can be evaluated on a test dataset to see how well it performs. The evaluation process involves feeding the images into the model and then comparing the model's predictions to the true labels of the images.

The code is for a CNN model that has been trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The CNN model achieves an accuracy of 94% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This means that the model correctly classifies 94% of the images in the dataset.

The CNN model that is a good example of how to build a CNN for image classification tasks. The model is relatively simple to build and train, and it achieves good performance on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
